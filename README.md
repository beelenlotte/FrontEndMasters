# FrontEndMasters
A glimps  of my own projects

Every branch represents a different brnach of exercies/themes
for example: the branch 'frontEndMasters' has all the exercises and projects I made following the Front-end path on frontendmasters.com.
Inside this branch you will see deifferent frolders. Each folder represents 1 exercise.

Note: inside an exercise folder, you will mostly see 2 folder
1. project
2. solution
the project is folder is how I made the exercise, if you want you can take a look at the solution folder to see how the instructor of the course have taackled the exercies.

Kind greetings,
Beelen Lotte
